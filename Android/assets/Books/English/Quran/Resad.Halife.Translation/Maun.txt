107/1 Do you know who really rejects the faith?
107/2 That is the one who mistreats the orphans.
107/3 And does not advocate the feeding of the poor.
107/4 And woe to those who observe the contact prayers (Salat)-
107/5 who are totally heedless of their prayers.
107/6 They only show off.
107/7 And they forbid charity.
