104/1 Woe to every backbiter, slanderer.
104/2 He hoards money and counts it.
104/3 As if his money will make him immortal.
104/4 Never; he will be thrown into the Devastator.
104/5 Do you know what the Devastator is?
104/6 GOD's blazing Hellfire.
104/7 It burns them inside out.
104/8 They will be confined therein.
104/9 In extended columns.
