95/1 By the fig and the olive.
95/2 Mount Sinai.
95/3 And this honored town (Mecca).
95/4 We created man in the best design.
95/5 Then turned him into the lowliest of the lowly.
95/6 Except those who believe and lead a righteous life; they receive a reward that is well deserved.
95/7 Why do you still reject the faith?
95/8 Is GOD not the Most Wise, of all the wise ones?
