99/1 When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake
99/2 And Earth yieldeth up her burdens,
99/3 And man saith: What aileth her?
99/4 That day she will relate her chronicles,
99/5 Because thy Lord inspireth her.
99/6 That day mankind will issue forth in scattered groups to beshown their deeds.
99/7 And whoso doeth good an atom's weight will see it then,
99/8 And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight will see it then.
