1/1 In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
1/2 Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,
1/3 The Beneficent, the Merciful.
1/4 Master of the Day of Judgment,
1/5 Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.
1/6 Show us the straight path,
1/7 The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) ofthose who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.
