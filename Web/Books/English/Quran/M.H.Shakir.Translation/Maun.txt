107/1 Have you considered him who calls the judgment a lie?
107/2 That is the one who treats the orphan with harshness,
107/3 And does not urge (others) to feed the poor.
107/4 So woe to the praying ones,
107/5 Who are unmindful of their prayers,
107/6 Who do (good) to be seen,
107/7 And withhold the necessaries of life.
