104/1 Woe to every slanderer, defamer,
104/2 Who amasses wealth and considers it a provision (againstmishap);
104/3 He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.
104/4 Nay! he shall most certainly be hurled into the crushingdisaster,
104/5 And what will make you realize what the crushing disasteris?
104/6 It is the fire kindled by Allah,
104/7 Which rises above the hearts.
104/8 Surely it shall be closed over upon them,
104/9 In extended columns.
