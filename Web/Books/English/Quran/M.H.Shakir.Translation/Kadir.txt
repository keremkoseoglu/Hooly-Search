97/1 Surely We revealed it on the grand night.
97/2 And what will make you comprehend what the grand night
97/3 The grand night is better than a thousand months.
97/4 The angels and Gibreel descend in it by the permission oftheir Lord for every affair,
97/5 Peace! it is till the break of the morning.
