94/1 Have We not expanded for you your breast,
94/2 And taken off from you your burden,
94/3 Which pressed heavily upon your back,
94/4 And exalted for you your esteem?
94/5 Surely with difficulty is ease.
94/6 With difficulty is surely ease.
94/7 So when you are free, nominate.
94/8 And make your Lord your exclusive object.
