102/1 Abundance diverts you,
102/2 Until you come to the graves.
102/3 Nay! you shall soon know,
102/4 Nay! Nay! you shall soon know.
102/5 Nay! if you had known with a certain knowledge,
102/6 You should most certainly have seen the hell;
102/7 Then you shall most certainly see it with the eye ofcertainty;
102/8 Then on that day you shall most certainly be questionedabout the boons.
