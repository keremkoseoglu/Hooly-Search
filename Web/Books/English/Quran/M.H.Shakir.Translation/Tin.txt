95/1 I swear by the fig and the olive,
95/2 And mount Sinai,
95/3 And this city made secure,
95/4 Certainly We created man in the best make.
95/5 Then We render him the lowest of the low.
95/6 Except those who believe and do good, so they shall havea reward never to be cut off.
95/7 Then who can give you the lie after (this) about thejudgment?
95/8 Is not Allah the best of the Judges?
