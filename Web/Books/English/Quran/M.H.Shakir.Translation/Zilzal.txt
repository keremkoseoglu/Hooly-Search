99/1 When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking,
99/2 And the earth brings forth her burdens,
99/3 And man says: What has befallen her?
99/4 On that day she shall tell her news,
99/5 Because your Lord had inspired her.
99/6 On that day men shall come forth in sundry bodies thatthey may be shown their works.
99/7 So. he who has done an atom's weight of good shall see it
99/8 And he who has done an atom's weight of evil shall seeit.
