1/1 In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
1/2 Praise be to GOD, Lord of the universe.
1/3 Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
1/4 Master of the Day of Judgment.
1/5 You alone we worship; You alone we ask for help.
1/6 Guide us in the right path;
1/7 the path of those whom You blessed; not of those who have deserved wrath, nor of the strayers.
