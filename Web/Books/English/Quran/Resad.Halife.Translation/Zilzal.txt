99/1 When the earth is severely quaked.
99/2 And the earth ejects its loads.
99/3 The human will wonder: "What is happening?"
99/4 On that day, it will tell its news.
99/5 That your Lord has commanded it.
99/6 On that day, the people will issue from every direction, to be shown their works.
99/7 Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it.
99/8 And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
