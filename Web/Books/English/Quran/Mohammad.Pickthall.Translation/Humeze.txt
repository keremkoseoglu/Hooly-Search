104/1 Woe unto every slandering traducer,
104/2 Who hath gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it.
104/3 He thinketh that his wealth will render him immortal.
104/4 Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One.
104/5 Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Consuming One is!
104/6 (It is) the fire of Allah, kindled,
104/7 Which leapeth up over the hearts (of men).
104/8 Lo! it is closed in on them
104/9 In outstretched columns.
