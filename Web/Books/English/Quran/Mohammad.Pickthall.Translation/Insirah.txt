94/1 Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate,
94/2 And eased thee of the burden
94/3 Which weighed down thy back;
94/4 And exalted thy fame?
94/5 But lo! with hardship goeth ease,
94/6 Lo! with hardship goeth ease;
94/7 So when thou art relieved, still toil
94/8 And strive to please thy Lord.
