97/1 Lo! We revealed it on the Night of Predestination.
97/2 Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Night of Power is!
97/3 The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.
97/4 The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permissionof their Lord, with all decrees.
97/5 (The night is) Peace until the rising of the dawn.
