95/1 By the fig and the olive,
95/2 By Mount Sinai,
95/3 And by this land made safe;
95/4 Surely We created man of the best stature
95/5 Then we reduced him to the lowest of the low,
95/6 Save those who believe and do good works, and theirs is areward unfailing.
95/7 So who henceforth will give the lie to thee about thejudgment?
95/8 Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges?
