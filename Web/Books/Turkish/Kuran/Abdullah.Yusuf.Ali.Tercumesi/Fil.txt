105/1 Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of theElephant?
105/2 Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?
105/3 And He sent against them Flights of Birds,
105/4 Striking them with stones of baked clay.
105/5 Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw,(of which the corn) has been eaten up.
