95/1 By the Fig and the Olive,
95/2 And the Mount of Sinai,
95/3 And this City of security,-
95/4 We have indeed created man in the best of moulds,
95/5 Then do We abase him (to be) the lowest of the low,-
95/6 Except such as believe and do righteous deeds: For they shallhave a reward unfailing.
95/7 Then what can, after this, contradict thee, as to the judgment(to come)?
95/8 Is not Allah the wisest of judges?
