114/1 Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,
114/2 The King (or Ruler) of Mankind,
114/3 The god (or judge) of Mankind,-
114/4 From the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil), who withdraws(after his whisper),-
114/5 (The same) who whispers into the hearts of Mankind,-
114/6 Among Jinns and among men.
