107/1 Seest thou one who denies the Judgment (to come)?
107/2 Then such is the (man) who repulses the orphan (withharshness),
107/3 And encourages not the feeding of the indigent.
107/4 So woe to the worshippers
107/5 Who are neglectful of their prayers,
107/6 Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
107/7 But refuse (to supply) (even) neighbourly needs.
