94/1 Have We not expanded thee thy breast?-
94/2 And removed from thee thy burden
94/3 The which did gall thy back?-
94/4 And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)?
94/5 So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief:
94/6 Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.
94/7 Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task),still labour hard,
94/8 And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.
