Hooly-Search
============

This project lets you browse through and search text within holy books. It has two versions: One of ASP.NET and one for Android.

This project has two purposes. The technical purpose is to demonstrate a simple method to search a query within multiple text files from within ASP.NET. Although it is much slower and memory consuming than querying text against a database, there might be some cases where a database is not an option. In such cases, this approach can be used.

The deeper purpose is to demonstrate that holy books can reside together in harmony.
